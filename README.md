> Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models have the ability to vividly generate a wide range of items with text guidance. However, generating a concept that is new to the model, such as oneself or one's pet, is a highly challenging task that has yet to be explored extensively. This task, known as **Subject-Driven Generation**, is challenging due to the limited training images for the subject and the potential to compromise the existing capabilities of the model while capturing the subject's unique characteristics. This paper proposes Adaptive Prompts (AdaPrompt) that can guide the diffusion model to generate images of a **new concept** in various contexts. AdaPrompt effectively captures the subject's characteristics and closely guides the model to generate authentic images of the subject. Additionally, it preserves existing concepts by operating solely in the textual input space without modifying the pre-trained model weights. Moreover, AdaPrompt is regularized with a novel **Compositional Delta Loss** to preserve its compositionality for building complex prompts. The advantages of AdaPrompt over existing methods, DreamBooth and Textual Inversion, have been validated through experiments on a set of few-shot subject images.

## Description

This repo contains the official code, data and sample generations for our AdaPrompt paper.

## Setup

Our code builds on, and shares requirements with [Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion). To set up the environment using conda, please run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ldm
```

To set up the the environment using pip, please run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please also install fish with `apt install fish`, which is required for running batch training/test scripts.

You will also need the official Stable Diffusion downloadable at [https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5).

## Usage

### Inversion

To invert an image set, run:

```bash
python3 main.py --base configs/stable-diffusion/v1-finetune-ada.yaml
         -t --actual_resume models/stable-diffusion-v-1-5/v1-5-pruned.ckpt
         -n <run_name> --gpus 0, --no-test
         --data_root data/subject_images/
         --subject_string <subject_string>
         --cls_delta_string "word1 word2..." --subj_init_word_weights w1 w2...
```

Example:

```jsx
python3 main.py --base configs/stable-diffusion/v1-finetune-ada.yaml 
         -t --actual_resume models/stable-diffusion-v-1-5/v1-5-pruned.ckpt          
         -n alexachung-ada --gpus 0, --no-test 
         --data_root data/alexachung/  
         --subject_string "z"  
         --cls_delta_string "young girl woman" 
         --subj_init_word_weights 1 2 2
```

where `subject_string` is a chosen uncommonly used single-token, such as ‘z’, ‘y’.

`cls_delta_string` is a few words that roughly describe the subject (e.g., 'man', ‘girl’, ‘dog’). It is used to initialize the low-rank semantic space of the subject embeddings.

`subj_init_word_weights` are the weights of each words in `cls_delta_string`. The number of weights are expected to be equal to the number of words. Intuitively, category words (”girl”, “man”, etc.) are given higher weights than modifier words (”young”, “chinese”, etc.).

The number of training iterations is specified in `configs/stable-diffusion/v1-finetune-ada.yaml`. We chose 4k training iterations.

To run on multiple GPUs, provide a comma-delimited list of GPU indices to the –gpus argument (e.g., `--gpus 0,1`)

Embeddings and output images will be saved in the log/<run_name> directory.

**Note**  All training set images should be upright, in square shapes, and clear (without obvious artifacts). Otherwise, the generated images will contain similar artifacts.

### Generation

To generate new images of the learned subject(s), run:

```bash
python scripts/stable_txt2img.py --config configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference-ada.yaml --ckpt models/stable-diffusion-v-1-5/v1-5-pruned.ckpt --ddim_eta 0.0
  --n_samples 8 --ddim_steps 50 --gpu 0 
  --embedding_paths logs/<run_name1>/checkpoints/embeddings_gs-4500.pt 
                    logs/<run_name2>/checkpoints/embeddings_gs-4500.pt
  --prompt "text containing the subject placeholder(s)" --scale 10 --n_iter 2
```

where multiple embedding paths can be specified for multi-subject composition. The prompt contains one or more placeholder tokens corresponding to the embedding checkpoints.

Example:

```bash
python3 scripts/stable_txt2img.py --config configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference-ada.yaml --ckpt models/stable-diffusion-v-1-5/v1-5-pruned.ckpt
--ddim_eta 0.0 --n_samples 8 --ddim_teps 50 --gpu 0
--embedding_paths 
   logs/donnieyen2023-02-20T23-52-39_donnieyen-ada/checkpoints/embeddings_gs-4500.pt 
   logs/lilbub2023-02-21T08-18-18_lilbub-ada/checkpoints/embeddings_gs-4500.pt 
--prompt "a z hugging a y" --scale 10 --n_iter 2
```
