# ada_prompts only differ from db_prompts in "stuffed toy" vs "stuffed animal". 
# Because individual words, rather than the whole phrase in ada_prompts impact the final embeddings. 
# "stuffed animal" is not an animal, so "stuffed toy" better suites AdaPrompt.
# But a prompt phrase like "stuffed animal" can be understood as a whole phrase by SD/DreamBooth.
